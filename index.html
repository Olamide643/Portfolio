            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics with expertise in data analysis, programming, statistics, machine learning, and software development. 
                In my current role as a data analyst, I design and evaluate credit scoring models, build classification models for identifying delinquent accounts, and analyze sales funnels to forecast sales.
                 I also develop inventory and sales reports, create dashboards for tracking marketing trends, and built a monitoring system to reduce correspondence costs. With three years of experience,
                 I excel in Python programming and am proficient in SQL, machine learning, and database design.
